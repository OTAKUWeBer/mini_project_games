## Installation

To run any of the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OTAKUWeBer/mini_project_games.git
   cd mini_projects_games
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run:**
   ```bash
   cd mini_project_games/project_name/
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

   Replace `filename.py` with the specific file name (`catch_the_fish_game.py`, `TicTacToe.py`, `to_do_list.py`, `pig.py`, `match_color.py`) of the project you want to run.

## Usage

Each project may have specific usage instructions detailed in its own directory. Generally, follow the on-screen prompts or command-line instructions provided by each project.

Enjoy exploring and playing with these mini projects and games!
